# Placement Score Prediction
<br/>
~ In this project, we are going to discuss how to predict the placement score of a student based on their using Linear regression algorithm.
<br/>
~ This study focuses on a system, that predicts if a student would be placed or not based on their CGPA. <br/>
~ This predictor uses a machine-learning algorithm to give the result. The algorithm used is Linear regression.

Linear Regression: <br/>
<br/>
~ Linear regression uses the relationship between the data-points to draw a straight line through all them.<br/>
~ This line can be used to predict future values.
